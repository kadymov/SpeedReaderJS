    <h3>Using</h2>
    Place the following code in the HEAD section of your code:
    <pre>
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;srjs.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;srjs.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    srjs.show();
&lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

    <h3>Demonstration</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Select text</li>
        <li>Press play</li>
    </ol>

In computer science and related fields, artificial neural networks are computational 
models inspired by animals' central nervous systems (in particular the brain) that 
are capable of machine learning and pattern recognition. They are usually presented 
as systems of interconnected "neurons" that can compute values from inputs by feeding 
information through the network.
For example, in a neural network for handwriting recognition, a set of input neurons 
may be activated by the pixels of an input image representing a letter or digit. The 
activations of these neurons are then passed on, weighted and transformed by some 
function determined by the network's designer, to other neurons, etc., until finally 
an output neuron is activated that determines which character was read.
Like other machine learning methods, neural networks have been used to solve a wide 
variety of tasks that are hard to solve using ordinary rule-based programming, 
including computer vision and speech recognition.
